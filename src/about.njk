    <h3>The Problem We're Solving</h3>
    <p class="lead">You're in your late 30s or 40s, trying to take your health seriously. One expert says eat only meat. Another says that'll kill you. You have 47 browser tabs open about "cellular aging" and you're more confused than when you started.</p>
    <p class="lead">The internet gave us unlimited access to information. But nobody gave us a filter.</p>

    <h3>Why This Exists</h3>
    <p>I started Withstain in 2024 because I was stuck in the same place.</p>
    <p>I was a tech executive in health and wellness. I had access to complex data, cutting-edge research, and industry experts. I was trying to get serious about my long-term health.</p>
    <p><strong>And I was completely paralyzed.</strong></p>
    <p>Not because I lacked information. Because I lacked a way to filter it.</p>
    <p>I needed something simple: a tool that would find my weakest link, cut through the contradictions, and tell me exactly what to do next.</p>
    <p>I couldn't find it. So I built it.</p>

    <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>

  <div class="container" style="margin-top: calc(var(--spacing-unit) * 6);">
    <div style="display: grid; gap: calc(var(--spacing-unit) * 6); max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">

      <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 80px 1fr; gap: calc(var(--spacing-unit) * 4); align-items: start;">

        <div>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Tool-First Philosophy</h4>
          <p>We don't start with content. We start with <a href="/tools/longevity-screener/">diagnostic tools</a> that identify your specific gaps. Content comes second, matched to what you actually need.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 80px 1fr; gap: calc(var(--spacing-unit) * 4); align-items: start;">

        <div>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Evidence Without the Equivocation</h4>
          <p>Our <a href="/articles/">research articles</a> give you the bottom line. We don't hide behind "it depends" or "more research is needed." We tell you what the current evidence actually suggests.</p>
        </div>

      <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 80px 1fr; gap: calc(var(--spacing-unit) * 4); align-items: start;">

        <div>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Three Steps, Not Twenty</h4>
          <p>Every screener gives you exactly 3 action steps. Not a overwhelming list. We believe it's better to master one habit that matters than get buried under ten that don't.</p>

    <p>Over 20 years leading technology teams in FinTech and Health Tech. Built and scaled ventures in complex, data-intensive industries. Avid endurance athlete.</p>
    <p>I saw the gap: massive amounts of health data and research, but very few tools that turn complexity into simple answers.</p>
    <p>I started Withstain to close that gap. I'm glad you're here.</p>
